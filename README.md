S2GS-Extractor
==============

Tool for automatically getting s2gs (StarCraft II Game Summary) files for a given character name/code

It does two things: 1) executes a simple macro to load someone's match history into the SC2 client, 2) finds and prints the locations of all the .s2gs files for games in that match history.
